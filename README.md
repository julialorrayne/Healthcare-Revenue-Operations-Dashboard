# Healthcare-Revenue-Operations-Dashboard

## Background and Overview
This project analyzes Horizon Care’s operational and billing data to evaluate revenue cycle performance, appointment efficiency, and financial impact of no-shows.

The dataset contains mock historical data from January 2023 to December 2025, representing patient appointments, billing activity, and provider information across multiple departments. 

The primary objective is to identify operational inefficiencies, such as no-show patterns and billing delays, and assess their financial impact to optimize operations and increase revenue.
